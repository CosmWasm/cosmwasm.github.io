# Getting started

This unit is designed to help you quickly become familiar with the fundamental aspects of testing
smart contracts using **MultiTest**. It provides a practical example and best practices to ensure
a smooth start with using **MultiTest** for testing smart contracts.
In the following chapters, you will be:

- designing an example [**counter**](./counter) smart contract,
- [**writing tests**](./counter) for the counter smart contract.

The example **counter** smart contract and all test cases are provided in two versions: one using
pure CosmWasm libraries and the other using the Sylvia framework. The functionality of the
**counter** smart contract is the same in both versions.
