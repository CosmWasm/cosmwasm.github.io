# Hello World!

As always, the goal of every _Hello World!_ exercise is to give you a feel of the technology,
but also to superficially experience how the concepts you learned map to something more tangible.
Don't hesitate to expand the collapsed sections if you want to dive deep on certain points,
with a view to better understand the mechanics of it.

These first steps take inspiration from the CosmWasm [docs' hello world](https://docs.cosmwasm.com/docs/getting-started/intro),
and from the Cosmos SDK's [basic tutorial](https://tutorials.cosmos.network/tutorials/3-run-node/).
The difference is that after you have downloaded all the packages and dependencies,
you no longer need access to other online resources.

It offers two tracks, you can either do all your compilations and running natively on your computer,
or achieve the same in Docker. If you choose the Docker path, that allows you to hold off installing anything other than Docker.

## What will happen

Here are the steps you are going to complete:

- Build the blockchain code.
- Create a running Cosmos blockchain:
  - With a single running node.
  - With CosmWasm installed
- Compile a smart contract code.
- Store the code and deploy a smart contract instance.
- Interact with it.

Let's get started.

[Install pre-requisites](https://docs.cosmwasm.com/core/installation). Either on your computer, or install Docker.
Including [JQ](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/).

## Build your blockchain code

Clone **wasmd**, which is the _simd_ of CosmWasm, at [v0.53.2](https://github.com/CosmWasm/wasmd/tree/v0.53.2).

```shell
git clone https://github.com/CosmWasm/wasmd --branch v0.53.2
cd wasmd
```

Build the blockchain application.

<Tabs groupId="local-docker">
  <TabItem value="Local" default>
    ```shell
    make build
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="Docker">
    ```shell
    docker build --tag wasmd:0.53.2 .
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

With this done, `.build/wasmd` or Docker's `wasmd:0.53.2` is your blockchain executable.


## Prepare your blockchain

After you have compiled your blockchain code, and before you can turn your focus to CosmWasm, you need a running blockchain.
This step has you prepare the blockchain application, test keys and a genesis file.

:::warning Are you a validator?

If you have previously used wasmd, you may already have data in your `~/.wasmd` folder.
It is typically safe to erase the `config` sub-folder. But **if you are a validator** on one of the wasmd networks,
this exercise is not safe, so stop right there or proceed at your own risks.

The Docker track also uses your local folder, by sharing it as a volume with the flag `-v $HOME/.wasmd:/root/.wasmd`,
so that you can switch to the local track at a later stage. Make space in the `~/.wasmd` folder:

```shell
rm -rf ~/.wasmd/config \
    ~/.wasmd/data \
    ~/.wasmd/wasm
```

:::

Initialize the blockchain application's genesis file and other configuration files.

<Tabs groupId="local-docker">
    <TabItem value="Local" active>
        ```shell
        ./build/wasmd init validator-1 \
            --chain-id learning-chain-1
        ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="Docker">
        ```shell
        docker run --rm -it \
            -v $HOME/.wasmd:/root/.wasmd \
            wasmd:0.53.2 \
            wasmd init validator-1 \
                --chain-id learning-chain-1
        ```
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

If you are curious, you can see what was created in `~/.wasmd`.

Then you can add a convenient but low-safety key for Alice, who shall become the validator operator.

<Tabs groupId="local-docker">
    <TabItem value="Local" active>
        ```shell
        ./build/wasmd keys add alice \
            --keyring-backend test
        ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="Docker">
        ```shell
        docker run --rm -it \
            -v $HOME/.wasmd:/root/.wasmd \
            wasmd:0.53.2 \
            wasmd keys add alice \
                --keyring-backend test
        ```
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Make a note of the seed phrase so that you can reuse it in a Node.js REPL console.

To become a validator, Alice needs an initial balance in the staking token. Give her one:

<Tabs groupId="local-docker">
    <TabItem value="Local" active>
        ```shell
        ./build/wasmd genesis \
            add-genesis-account alice 100000000stake \
            --keyring-backend test
        ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="Docker">
        ```shell
        docker run --rm -it \
            -v $HOME/.wasmd:/root/.wasmd \
            wasmd:0.53.2 \
            wasmd genesis \
                add-genesis-account alice 100000000stake \
                --keyring-backend test
        ```
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Have Alice create and sign the token-staking transaction that will make Alice an initial validator.

<Tabs groupId="local-docker">
    <TabItem value="Local" active>
        ```shell
        ./build/wasmd genesis \
            gentx alice 70000000stake \
            --keyring-backend test \
            --chain-id learning-chain-1
        ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="Docker">
        ```shell
        docker run --rm -it \
            -v $HOME/.wasmd:/root/.wasmd \
            wasmd:0.53.2 \
            wasmd genesis \
                gentx alice 70000000stake \
                --keyring-backend test \
                --chain-id learning-chain-1
        ```
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

The system tells you that a file has been created with a signed transaction in it.
Add this signed transaction to the genesis file so that Alice starts indeed as a validator.

<Tabs groupId="local-docker">
    <TabItem value="Local" active>
        ```shell
        ./build/wasmd genesis collect-gentxs
        ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="Docker">
        ```shell
        docker run --rm -it \
            -v $HOME/.wasmd:/root/.wasmd \
            wasmd:0.53.2 \
            wasmd genesis collect-gentxs
        ```
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::info

The blockchain preparation is now done, and you need not redo the above steps if you restart this exercise at a later date.
